## Ola Krutrim - Embodied AI
![](/projects/images/ola_krutrim_logo.png)
I worked to develop and integrate a pipeline for the planning and control of a 4W ADAS system using Nav2 stack on ROS2. We were implementing an SMAC Planner and MPPI controller-based implementation.

NVIDIA ISaac was used to evaluate the system, and on-ground testing was conducted on a Honda City, tracking pre-defined trajectories and on-road testing.

I also worked on a LIDAR Camera fusion pipeline for a five-camera system used to generate a costmap for local planning with the MPPI Controller.
